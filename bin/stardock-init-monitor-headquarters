# Monitor Headquarters
#
# We poll the headquarters (our central config) for updates
# and when we find updates we take various actions.  The
# central config has the ability to drop files on the root
# file system and as such we will restart services on the
# host OS when configured to do so.  We tell NGINX to hup
# because there may be implications to the changes inside
# the proxy to our services
